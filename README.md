# Open Computational Physics

<img src="laplace-poisson/images/single_charge.png" width="200"/>

Open Computational Physics is the collection of all the projects made by me during the **Computational Physics with Laboratory** (22018) course in *[Universit√† degli Studi di Palermo](https://www.unipa.it/)*. The course is held by professor *Grazia Cottone*.

## References

All the references used in the various projects are written in the single project readme, 

For the more general references we have the courses notes and materials, [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) documentation, [Numpy API](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/) reference and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html) tutorials (which are incredibly handy).

The simulations for Molecular Dynamics were made using a modified version of the **C** code used in [Drexel](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~cfa22/msim/node21.html) course **Molecular Simulations** by *Cameron Abrams*.

## Installation - Dependencies

Please refer to the various README of the argument you're interested with. Most of the projects make use of common Python 3 libraries.

Python dependencies tested:
  * **python 3** (3.8+)
  * **matplotlib** (3.4+)
  * **numpy** (1.21+)
  * **scipy** (1.7+)
